# Please note

This version of the monopile model does *not* include a soil
model at this time. For simplicity, we have fixed the tower
in all 6 DOFs at the mudline. If you have a soil model, you
are very welcome to make a pull request with your changes.

Furthermore, this model has only been lightly tested compared
to the fixed-substructure model. Therefore there may be some
issues that arise when you use it. If you find a bug in the
model, please raise an issue so that we can address it. Thanks!
