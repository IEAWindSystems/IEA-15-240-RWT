# IEA Wind 15-MW RWT: WindIO YAML Ontology Files
 
These files contain the full description of the 15-MW RWT according to the "ontology" defined in the IEA Wind Task 37 [WindIO](https://github.com/IEAWindTask37/windIO) project.  The files are provided in YAML-format, a human-readable and computer-parseable structure.  For now, only the monopile variant is described in the ontology.  Future efforts will generate a WindIO ontology file for the University of Maine Volturn-S Semisubmersible variant as well.
