# IEA-15-240-RWT
This repository contains the model data for the 15 MW offshore reference turbine developed within IEA Wind Task 37.

The documentation for the turbine is accessable here: https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/75698.pdf

Data in this repository includes:
* Documentation, including tabular data used in the figures from the technical report
* OpenFAST aeroelastic model inputs (compatable with the latest "dev" branch available: https://github.com/OpenFAST/openfast.git)
* HAWC2 aeroelastic model inputs
* WISDEM optimization files
* Wind turbine ontology .yaml files
* CAD modeling of turbine in SolidWorks and an Ansys FEA model of the blades

Note that the OpenFAST model uses the NREL's [Reference OpenSource Controller (ROSCO)](https://github.com/nrel/rosco).  Users will need to compile the dynamic library following the ROSCO install instructions and need to provide relavent path to the dynamic library within ServoDyn.  [Tools](https://github.com/NREL/ROSCO_toolbox) also exist for automatically retuning the controller, updating the "Cp_Ct_Cq.IEA15MW.txt" and "DISCON.IN" files that are inputs to ROSCO.  Please use OpenFAST-v2.2.0 or later, the OpenFAST model has not been tested for backwards compatability.
